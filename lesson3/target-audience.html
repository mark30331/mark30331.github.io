            The target-audience are people who need the weather for their daily 
            purposes. Such persons are the farmer, the bus driver and many others. 
            The audience may use the weather predictions to determine many aspects 
            of their day. The target-audience may also use this website to protect 
            life and property.

                This person is a 47 years old farmer whose farm is in covered by this website.
                This hardworking farmer needs to know what the weather is expected for everyday 
                person he takes action. He also needs to know whether there's gonna be heavy rainstorms
                or any weather disaster so that he can plan and organize his day ahead of time.

                This is a construction company that operates within the region covered by this website. 
                Construction companies large and small also need to stay ahead of the weather, both in real-time and
                longer seasonal outlooks. For instance, a company operating with a crane will need accurate wind speed
                and direction forecasts to ensure the loads lifted do not sway needlessly. Working in the rain is never
                fun but accurate rainfall rate forecasts allow a concrete pour to proceed overnight and keep the project
                ahead of schedule.

        <h2>
            Scenarios
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I am planning on going out to play soccer with friends on the field. 
                I need to know what the weather forecast is so that I can plan ahead of 
                time.                 
            </li>
            <li>
                As a farmer, I am planning on growing food crops today. I need to know if 
                 there is going to be any thunderstroms so that in cause of planting, it does 
                 not destroy or affect my crops. 
            </li>
            <li>
                I am a caretaker and I need to send the kids to school in the morning. 
                I need to know if it is good to walk or drive them to school because, in case there 
                is unfavorable weather conditions then I would have to drive them rather than walk in 
                a thunderstrom. 

            </li>
            <li>
                This construction company needs to start building a house next week. They want to find 
                out if the weather conditions is favorable before they start their project. They don't want 
                to start and get their resources destroyed.

            </li>
            <li>
                I and some close friends plan on going camping next month. We do not know what the weather is 
                going to be like. We need to check the website for weather forecasts so we don't encouter any 
                difficulties. 
            </li>
        </ul>
